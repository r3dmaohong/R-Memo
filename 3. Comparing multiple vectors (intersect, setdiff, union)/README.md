# 3. Comparing multiple vectors (intersect, setdiff, union)

####Contains 
 - Intersection
 - Difference
 - Union
 - Using "Reduce" to set union(or others) on multiple vectors

================
```
## Intersection :
intersect(x, y)

## Difference :
setdiff(x, y)

## Union :
union(x, y2)

## Multiple vectors
Reduce(intersect, list(x, y, z))
```
